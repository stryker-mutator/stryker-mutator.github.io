**Breaking News**: Code Mutation Testing Introduces _Emoji Mutations_!

In a world where even our code needs a little bit of fun, Code Mutation Testing is proud to announce the introduction of Emoji Mutations. From now on, our state-of-the-art mutation testing algorithms will automatically detect all emojis in your code and replace them with their mutated counterparts!

From now on, any code that contains an emoji will have that emoji mutated to its counterpart. For example, a sad face (😔) will be mutated to a happy face (😊), a heart eyes (😍) will be mutated to a crying face (😭), and a laughing face (😂) will be mutated to a grumpy face (😡).

Update to the latest version of Stryker.JS, Stryker.NET or Stryker4s to enjoy this newest feature ✨

## 🧐 The problem

At first glance, this may seem like a silly feature. But we have some serious reasoning behind it! Studies have shown that the emotional tone of code can affect how developers interact with it. If a codebase is full of negative emotions (like sadness), developers may be less likely to want to work on it. On the other hand, if a codebase is full of positive emotions (like happiness), developers may be more likely to engage with it.

If you've used Stryker before you will have noticed it mutates all your code except for Emojis. Even though Emojis are becoming a more and more important part of programming languages. Nowadays there exist [complete code languages revolving around Emojis](https://www.emojicode.org/docs/reference/welcome.html).

## ⏩ Introducing the Emoji mutator

By introducing emoji mutations, we can help ensure that codebases are emotionally balanced and inviting for developers to work on. Plus, it's just plain fun to see sad faces turn into happy faces!

😂 becomes 😭 - because sometimes you need to cry from laughing too hard!

🍕 becomes 🥦 - for those who need a little push to eat healthier while coding.

🤔 becomes 🤯 - because coding can be mind-boggling!

💻 becomes 🧚‍♀️ - for when coding feels like magic.

😡 becomes 😇 - to promote positivity and forgiveness when dealing with frustrating code.

🐛 becomes 🦋 - for when those pesky bugs finally get fixed.

🔥 becomes ❄️ - because sometimes you need to cool down a heated discussion about code.

💩 becomes 💎 - because even the ugliest code can turn into a gem with some polishing.

🎉 becomes 🧨 - for those who like to live dangerously while celebrating a successful deployment.

🤖 becomes 🐒 - to remind ourselves that even the most advanced technologies still have roots in the natural world.

**Note:** We can't guarantee that the mutation will impact your actual emotion.

## 🔮 What's next

We believe this will not only improve the quality of your code, but also make your work more fun and enjoyable! Try it out today and let us know what you think. Happy coding (or should we say, 😂👨‍💻🎉)!
