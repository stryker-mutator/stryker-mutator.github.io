Wait no longer to see the results of your mutation testing! With this new addition to Stryker.NET, you can receive real-time feedback, enabling you to identify and address survived mutants as soon as they are identified!

<!-- truncate -->

## Getting started

Install Stryker.NET version 3.8.0 or higher using the [getting started](/docs/stryker-net/getting-started/), or update the dotnet-stryker tool version to at least 3.8.0 in your `.config/dotnet-tools.json` file and run `dotnet tool restore`:

```diff
"tools": {
    "dotnet-stryker": {
+      "version": "3.8.0",
      "commands": ["dotnet-stryker"]
    }
  }
```

Enable real-time reporting with `dotnet run stryker --open-report` (or `-o` for short) in Stryker.NET!

## The problem

Mutation testing is a slow process, and developers must wait until the end of the mutation test to see results. This delay in feedback can result in a long inner dev loop, as developers may need to spend additional time debugging and fixing issues that could have been identified earlier in the process.

## The solution

With real-time reporting, the HTML report updates whenever a new mutant result is available, providing developers with _immediate feedback_. As a result, developers can identify and address issues in their code earlier because they don't have to wait until mutation testing finishes to see results.

## Demo

Everything in the report gets updated:

import ReactPlayer from 'react-player';

<ReactPlayer playing controls url="/videos/realtime-reporting.mp4" width="100%" height="100%" />

It is also possible to view a file with mutants that have not run yet (these mutants are marked as `Pending`):

## What's next?

Now that this feature is implemented for Stryker.NET, we will be focussing of getting it into all other flavors as well. So look forward to real-time reporting comming to StrykerJS and Stryker4s in the near future.

Furthermore, since [we're sharing the HTML report as a separate open source project](/blog/2019-04-03-one-mutation-testing-html-report.md), we encourage other mutation testing frameworks to start implementing this feature as well. We'll add documentation to [mutation-testing-elements](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/mutation-testing-elements/) to help implementers soon.
