## Better CI integration

[Original PR](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker/pull/355)

It's now possible to let your build fail based on your mutation score.
The way to do this is to make sure stryker runs inside your (nightly) build and configure the `threshold.break` value:

```javascript
// stryker.conf.js
// ...
thresholds: {
    break: 70, // Fail if mutation score < 70
    // ..
}
// ...
```

This will break the build if your mutation score falls below 70%.

```bash
[2017-08-11 13:46:10.190] [ERROR] ScoreResultCalculator - Final mutation score 66.97 under breaking threshold 70, setting exit code to 1 (failure).
npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE
npm ERR! errno 1
npm ERR! stryker@0.8.0 stryker: `node bin/stryker run`
```

Want to know what a 'mutation score' is? See [our faq](../docs/General/faq.md).

## Configurable color thresholds

[Original PR](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker/pull/355)

The clear-text and html reporters now honor configured high and low thresholds.
You once again configure it using the `thresholds` config option:

```javascript
// stryker.conf.js
// ...
thresholds: {
    high: 80,
    low: 60,
    // ...
}
// ...
```

Configuring these values will color mutation scores above 80% <span class="text-success">green</span>, between 80 and 60% <span class="text-warning">yellow</span> and anything below 60% <span class="text-danger">red</span>.
You can see an example of an html report based on stryker itself [here](https://stryker-mutator.github.io/stryker-html-reporter).
