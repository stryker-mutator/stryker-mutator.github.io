An introduction to mutation testing

_How code coverage of 100% could mean only 60% is tested._

<img alt="RoboBar application" src={useBaseUrl('images/RoboBar.webp')} />

## TL;DR

No time to run the example yourself? Don't worry. We did it for you. Open it right in your browser:

- [The RoboBar website](https://stryker-mutator.io/robobar-example/)
- [Coverage report](https://stryker-mutator.io/robobar-example/reports/coverage/lcov-report/index.html)
- [Mutation report](https://dashboard.stryker-mutator.io/reports/github.com/stryker-mutator/robobar-example/master)

## What is this?

The RoboBar is a small application to demonstrate mutation testing. It actually has a fair number of unit tests.
When we wrote this application, we didn't even try our best to write bad tests.
We just focussed on code coverage and didn't practice Test Driven Development.
It turns out it's straightforward to write bad tests or forget a few essential test cases.
The RoboBar even has a reasonably large bug. Finding it is pretty easy using the mutation report.
Why don't you give it a try? üòÅ

## Try it yourself

1. Install [git](https://git-scm.com)
1. Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/)
1. Open command prompt and clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stryker-mutator/robobar-example
   ```
1. Change directory into the robobar and install the dependencies.
   ```bash
   cd robobar-example
   npm install
   ```
1. Run tests with npm. This will generate a code coverage report.
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
1. Review the 100% code coverage score. Open up the code coverage report located in the `reports/coverage/lcov-report/index.html` file.
1. Run mutation testing with [Stryker](https://stryker-mutator.io)
   ```bash
   npm run test:mutation
   ```
1. Review the 50% mutation score. Open up the mutation report located in the `reports/mutation` directory.
1. Run the website with `npm start`. Can you find the bug?

## Try to install stryker yourself.

If you want to install stryker yourself, step back in history using git:

```bash
git reset --hard
git checkout e92b8d4
npm install
```

After that you can install stryker for yourself:

```bash
npm i -g stryker-cli
stryker init
```

Choose the following options in the questionnaire:

- Install stryker?: `Yes`
- Test runner: `Karma`
- Test framework: `Jasmine`
- Language: `javascript`
- Transformations: _none_
- Reporters: `html, clear text, progress`

After the plugins are installed, try it out:

```bash
stryker run
```
