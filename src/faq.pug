                ## Q: Stryker is slow! How do I speed it up?  
                **A: Improve your tests' performance**  
                As we're running *your* tests, the first thing you should do, is to improve the performance of your unit tests.
                For example: when running tests in a browser, try to reduce the number of files loaded in the browser. 

                **A: Only mutate what's needed**  
                Make sure you're not mutating unnecessary files (e.g. test files, third party code, etc.)  
                Double-check your `files` and `mutate` settings.

                **A: Create a RAM disk/drive**  
                Take a look at your disk I/O. Is it peaking when running Stryker? Consider creating a RAM disk!  
                This will speed up writing and/or reading intermediate files (such as temporary HTML files) by doing everything in your secondary storage.  
                *Note*: We didn't test this ourselves yet. So take it with a grain of salt. ;-)

                ## Q: I found a bug! What do I do now?
                **A: First [take a look at the known issues](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker/issues) before filing an issue yourself**  
                You can also [contact us on Gitter](https://gitter.im/stryker-mutator/stryker) and ask if the (mis)behavior you've encountered is known.  
                When reporting an issue, please read [our documentation on how to report bugs](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#bug-triage).
