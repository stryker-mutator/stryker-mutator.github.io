                ## Q: Stryker is slow! How do I speed it up?  
                **A: Improve your tests' performance**  
                As we're running *your* tests, the first thing you should do, is to improve the performance of your unit tests. 

                **A: Only mutate what's needed**  
                Make sure you're not mutating unnecessary files (e.g. unrelated test files, third party code, etc.)  
                Double-check your `files` setting and try a `run` with `--mutate ''` to perform a dry-run.

                **A: Create a RAM disk/drive**  
                Take a look at your disk I/O. Is it peaking when running Stryker? Consider creating a RAM disk!  
                This will speed up writing and/or reading intermediate files (such as temporary HTML files) by doing everything in your secondary storage.  
                *Note*: We didn't test this ourselves yet. So take it with a grain of salt. ;-)

                ## Q: I found a bug! What do I do now?
                **A: Contact us on Gitter first, then file an issue on GitHub**
