        Unit testing is often explained by writing a calculator app. It’s logic that everyone understands and it works in pretty much every language. 
        Functions of a calculator, such as multiplying numbers, should be pretty easy to test but they already create problems. 
        You have to multiply positive numbers, negative numbers, one negative number with a positive one etc. 
        Before you know it, you have a bunch of tests for a simple method. Does that mean your done? How do you even know if you’re done testing?

        Well, you would use code coverage! Right?

        ## The code coverage problem
        I used to think that code coverage tells you which code is tested. But I realized I was wrong. Code coverage doesn’t tell you which code is tested, it only tells you which code is being executed during testing. There is an important difference here. You could write one test which hits 100 lines of code, but that doesn’t mean that all 100 lines of code work as you would expect. If you would write 10 tests for that piece of code, you may still have the same code coverage. You could even write tests without assertions to boost your code coverage.

        And how do you know that enough is enough? Some teams even have code coverage goals that they have to hit (100% anyone?). As if that would make you write better tests. Sure, it forces you to write tests, but it doesn’t promise that they’re good tests. It even encourages bad behavior for some people. During one of my projects as a student, our school decided a little competition would be fun. The team with the highest code coverage at the end of the project would win a small prize. It didn’t take long to find out that tests could be written without assertions to easily boost their code coverage (of course, I would never do that ;)).

        The only way to know that a test actually *works* is when it fails when you make a code change.

        ## Mutation testing
        You could go through your code base and make changes to see if certain tests fail. However, this process is time consuming. You're much better off using a mutation testing framework. A mutation testing framework will look through your code to see where it can introduce bugs, which we will call *mutants* from now on.

        Say you have the following code:
        ```javascript
        if (a > b) {
            ....
        }
        ```
        A mutation testing framework could find the first line, and determine to change it in a number of ways:
        ```javascript
        /* 1 */ if (a >= b) {
        /* 2 */ if (a < b) {
        /* 3 */ if (true) {
        /* 4 */ if (false) {
        ```

        Each one of those mutants should make a test fail. After the mutants have been found, they are applied one by one and your tests will be executed. If at least one of your tests fail, we say the mutant is *killed*. If no tests fail, it *survived*. The better your tests, the less mutants survive.

        With mutation testing you’re testing your tests.

        ## Getting started
        Most languages have a mutation testing framework. Just take a look on GitHub and you will probably find one for the language you use. 
        If you’re using JavaScript, I would suggest looking at Stryker. 

        The best thing to do if you’re not already using mutation testing is to just try it once. You may find that there are a lot of mutations that survive, but that’s ok.

        ## Setting goals
        After you’ve used a mutation framework a couple of times, you may think about setting a mutation testing goal, 
        just like with your code coverage goal. I sometimes get asked what a good goal is for mutation testing. 
        It can be a difficult question to answer and I honestly don’t know what a good goal is for your application. 
        
        Mutation testing frameworks make very different changes depending on the language or even framework you’re using.
        Stryker could assign any value to any variable since we’re testing JavaScript. That doesn’t work for a framework like [PIT](http://pitest.org/),
        which can be used to mutation test Java code. This means that your score could differ a lot, depending on the language and framework you use. 
        The goal you want to set may also differ depending on the type of application that you're writing. A banking application may require a higher mutation score.

        I would suggest running a mutation testing framework and set a higher goal than your current score. 
        I would not advise to make 100% mutation coverage your goal though. The most important thing is that you write good tests and mutation testing can help you achieve that. 
        So if you’re going to set any goal, make writing good tests your goal.
