        A new major version of Stryker has been released: version 2.0.0.
        This blog post will cover some of the changes. For a full list of changes, please read [our changelog](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#200-2019-05-17).

        If you run into any issues using the latest version of Stryker, please let us know!

        ## Breaking changes
        This major release comes with some breaking changes:
        1. NodeJS version 8 or higher is now required to run Stryker
        2. The code of Stryker is now es2017 code instead of es5

        ## Deprecations
        The use of mocha version 5 and below is deprecated. Please upgrade to mocha 6 or above. See [their changelog](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#600--2019-02-18) for more information about upgrading.
        Support for mocha version 5 and below will be removed in the future (with Stryker v3 probably).

        ## What's new
        Prettier has been removed as a direct dependency. We use prettier when initially writing your stryker.conf.js to disk. 
        We now run prettier using the npx command instead of packaging it with Stryker.

        We've updated our source-map dependency to enable lazy loading. This ensures that coverage data is only mapped when (and if) it's required.

        VueJS files are only mutated when they contain `<script>` blocks.
        
        ## Migration
        Migrating to the latest major version is easy! Just update all `@stryker-mutator` dependencies to at least version 2.0.0. If you are still using version 0.x.x, then please look at [our blog post regarding stryker v1](https://stryker-mutator.io/blog/2019-02-13/announcing-stryker-1-0).

        ## Release schedule

        We'll keep improving Stryker by fixing nasty bugs, improving code (and test) quality and by adding new features. 
        The next major release of Stryker will probably be at the start of 2020 due to the LTS support of NodeJS version 8 ending.
