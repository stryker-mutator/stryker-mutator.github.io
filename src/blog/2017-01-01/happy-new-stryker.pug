                ## 2017 - The year to invest into test quality
                Up until now, when you were writing unit tests, you were actually investing in *code quality*. Catching bugs early by continuously
                exercising your code with unit tests and keeping your stakeholders happy by presenting them with a code coverage number of 85 % or higher.  
                But what if those tests contain bugs too? How would you go about discovering that? How do you test *your tests*?  
                That's the problem [mutation testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing) sets out to solve.  

                ### Mutation testing in JavaScript
                Due to JavaScript's dynamic nature, unit testing has become a fundamental tool to bring a higher level of robustness to JavaScript projects.
                Your average AngularJS app can easily have around 10,000 unit tests. Ensuring that these cover the code as well as possible is very desireable.  
                [Stryker Mutator](http://stryker-mutator.github.io/) is our approach to providing a comprehensive mutation testing tool for the JavaScript environment.

                We start out by altering your source code ever so slightly (e.g. turning a `+` into `-`) and then running your tests to see if they are 
                resilient to this *"mutation"*. If they are (and they fail), all is fine - the *mutant is dead*. If they don't, the *mutant* survived and you have to fix your test.

                ## Stryker Hackweek 2016
                Stryker began its life as the thesis project of Simon de Lang. After graduating, his thesis tutor Nico Jansen joined him and continued development in the open on [GitHub](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/).  
                Since then they had five major releases, improving performance, adding support for the [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html) and [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) test runners, 
                as well as creating a fancy [HTML reporter](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-html-reporter).

                Up until now, the two of them did all of this in their own time, next to their daytime jobs as software engineers.

                Around came the traditionally slow Christmas time period, allowing a select few of their colleagues at [Info Support](https://www.infosupport.com/) to join them for 4 days for the ***Stryker Hackweek 2016***.

                ### Achieved goals
                The whole team enjoyed the experience a lot and had good fun extending Stryker and fixing issues.  
                We mostly concentrated on integrating Stryker with SonarQube, as well as improving the first time usage experience.  

                All in all we made <p style="color: red;">{NUMBER OF COMMITS}, closing {NUMERB OF CLOSED ISSUES} etc.</p>
                Here's a quick overview of what we did:
                * Created a [Stryker SonarQube plugin](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/sonar-stryker-plugin), that turns survived mutants into neat SonarQube issues
                * Added [a blog](http://stryker-mutator.github.io/blog.html) to the Stryker homepage
                * Upgraded the TypeScript compiler in all projects to 2.1
                * Added support to [exclude online files from globbing](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker/issues/90)
                * Released [version 0.5.5 of Stryker](http://stryker-mutator.github.io/blog/2016-12-30/stryker-0-5-5.html), including:
                * Improved documentation for first time-users
                * A plan for a series of blog articles
