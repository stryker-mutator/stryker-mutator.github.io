        Over the years, we've been privileged to explain the concept of Mutation Testing to great developers, testers and others. 
        The concept of _inserting bugs into your production code_ in order to _test your tests_ sparks the imagination. 

        But when people start using mutation testing in practice, they 
        quickly realize that things are not as easy as they seem. 
        One of the most common questions is: "what 'mutation score' is good enough"? 
        Our general advice is not to strive for 100%. But should you use 80%? Or some other percentage? 
        Some users just want to see that everything is great with their tests.

        That's why we're introducing a new '100%' mode!
        With this mode, Stryker itself will strive to improve your mutation score to be 100%. 
        You can activate it with the `--100` command line flag, 
        but we're thinking of making this the default mode.

        ## 🙉 An example

        A picture says more than a thousand words. First without the new `--100` mode:

    img(alt="Without 100 mode", src="/images/blogs/stryker-without-100-mode.png" class="img-fluid")

    :markdown-it
        And now with the new `--100` mode:

    img(alt="With 100 mode", src="/images/blogs/stryker-with-100-mode.png" class="img-fluid")

    :markdown-it
        As you can see, this new mode makes for a far better-looking report! 
        
        And things just keep getting better. Since all mutants will be _killed - no matter what_, you'll not have to wait long, 
        because Stryker can internally optimize the process to _not do actual testing whatsoever_. A huge performance gain!

        ## 🔮 What's next?

        Seeing as this is such an obvious improvement, it will not take long for other mutation testing frameworks 
        to follow suit. That's why it's only a matter of time before 
        the legendary [Mull](https://github.com/mull-project/mull#mull), 
        [InfectionPHP](https://infection.github.io/guide/) and [Pitest](https://pitest.org/) will have this new and very important feature.

        Don't hesitate to open an issue if this important mode is missing.
