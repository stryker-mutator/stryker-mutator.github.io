        ## Better CI integration

        [Original PR](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker/pull/355)

        It's now possible to let your build fail based on your mutation score. 
        The way to do this is to make sure stryker runs inside your (nightly) build and configure the `threshold.break` value:

        ```javascript
        // stryker.conf.js
        // ...
        thresholds: {
            break: 70, // Fail if mutation score < 70
            // ..
        }
        // ...
        ```

        This will break the build if your mutation score falls below 70%.

        ```bash
        [2017-08-11 13:46:10.190] [ERROR] ScoreResultCalculator - Final mutation score 66.97 under breaking threshold 70, setting exit code to 1 (failure).
        npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE
        npm ERR! errno 1
        npm ERR! stryker@0.8.0 stryker: `node bin/stryker run`
        ```

        ## Configurable color thresholds

        [Original PR](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker/pull/355)

        The clear-text and html reporters now honor configured high and low thresholds. 
        You once again configure it using the `thresholds` config option:

        ```javascript
        // stryker.conf.js
        // ...
        thresholds: {
            high: 80,
            low: 60,
            // ...
        }
        // ...
        ```

        Configuring these values will color mutation scores above 80% <span class="text-success">green</span>, between 80 and 60% <span class="text-warning">yellow</span> and anything below 60% <span class="text-danger">red</span>.
        You can see an example of an html report based on stryker itself [here](https://stryker-mutator.github.io/stryker-html-reporter).
