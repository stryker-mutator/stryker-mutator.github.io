                # Plugins

                Stryker supports a number of plugins, which are listed below. You can also [search npm for the stryker-plugin tag](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=stryker-plugin). 
                
                Missing something? Feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker/issues) or 
                use the [stryker-plugin-seed](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-plugin-seed) to create your own plugin.

                ## Test runners
                * Karma ([stryker-karma-runner](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-karma-runner))
                * Mocha ([stryker-mocha-runner](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-mocha-runner))

                ## Test frameworks
                Stryker is test framework agnostic, however if you plugin hooks to the test framework you are using, it can significantly improve the performance.
                We don't have any test frameworks as plugins right now. They are planned for the next major release of stryker (0.5). We do have limitted support for Jasmine built into Stryker. Enable it by setting the testSelector to `jasmine`.

                ## Reporters
                * HTML Reporter ([stryker-html-reporter](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-html-reporter))

                ## Mutators
                We don't have any mutators as plugins yet, but we do have list of [mutators that are included with Stryker](/mutators.html)

                ## Config writers
                None so far.
