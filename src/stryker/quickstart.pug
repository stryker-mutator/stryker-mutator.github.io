            :markdown-it
                Make sure you have npm and nodejs installed. Open a terminal / command prompt and cd to the root of your project you want to mutation test.
            
                ```shell
                $ cd my-project
                ```

            :markdown-it
                The easiest way to get started with Stryker is by installing the stryker-cli globally. 
                It is a small package which forwards commands to your local stryker instance. 
                            
                ```shell
                $ npm install -g stryker-cli
                ```

                Optionally, you could also install stryker directly yourself.
                
                ```shell
                $ npm install --save-dev @stryker-mutator/core
                ```
                
                If you choose to not install the stryker-cli, use `npx stryker` (after installing `@stryker-mutator/core` locally) instead of `stryker` for the rest of the quickstart.

            :markdown-it
                Run this command the configure stryker.
                
                ```shell
                $ stryker init
                ```

                If you're asked to install stryker, choose **Yes**. Follow the questionnaire.
                
                Please let us know if your option is missing here [by opening an issue](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker/issues).

                After the init is done, inspect the `stryker.conf.js` file. 
                
                For more information on what these options mean, take a look at the [Stryker readme](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker/tree/master/packages/core#readme)

                Having troubles? Try enabling debug logging by adding `logLevel: 'debug'` to your stryker.conf.js. 
                To also see output of your test runner, use `logLevel: 'trace'`. 
                You can also have a look at the [readme file of stryker](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker/tree/master/packages/core#readme) for more information about the configuration.
