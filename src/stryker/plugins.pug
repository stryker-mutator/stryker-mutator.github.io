        Stryker supports a number of plugins, which are listed below. You can also [search npm for the stryker-plugin tag](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=stryker-plugin). 
        
        Don't worry about the reporters if you're just starting out. The needed plugins will be installed for you if you're following out [quickstart](/stryker/quickstart).

        ## Test runners

        * Jest ([stryker-jest-runner](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker/tree/master/packages/stryker-jest-runner))
        * Karma ([stryker-karma-runner](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker/tree/master/packages/stryker-karma-runner))
        * Mocha ([stryker-mocha-runner](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker/tree/master/packages/stryker-mocha-runner))

        ## Test frameworks

        Stryker is test framework agnostic, however if you plugin hooks to the test framework you are using, it can significantly improve the performance
        by using `coverageAnalysis: 'perTest'`. For more information about coverage analysis, see the [stryker readme](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker/tree/master/packages/stryker#coverage-analysis).
                    
        * Jasmine ([stryker-jasmine](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker/tree/master/packages/stryker-jasmine))
        * Mocha ([stryker-mocha-runner](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker/tree/master/packages/stryker-mocha-runner))

        ## Reporters
        
        Stryker already has 4 reporters build in:
        * `progress`: Report progress during mutation testing.
        * `dots`: Report progress as dots during mutation testing.
        * `clear-text`: A clear text report at the end of the mutation testing phase.
        * `event-recorder`: Write all events to disk. Useful for debug purposes (default location: 'reports/mutation/events')

        The html reporter can be installed a separate dependency. It can generate [an html report](https://stryker-mutator.github.io/stryker-html-reporter).
        For more info, see the [stryker-html-reporter readme](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker/tree/master/packages/stryker-html-reporter#readme)

        ## Mutators
        
        The actual mutating part of your code is done via a mutator plugin. 
        * **JavaScript** ([stryker-javascript-mutator](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker/tree/master/packages/stryker-javascript-mutator)) \
          Can mutate JavaScript files using babel as a parser. It can also mutate [flow-js](https://flow.org/) code.
        * **TypeScript** ([stryker-typescript-mutator](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker/tree/master/packages/stryker-typescript)) \
          Can mutate TypeScript files using the TypeScript parser.
        * **Vue** ([stryker-javascript-mutator](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker/tree/master/packages/stryker-javascript-mutator)) \
          Can mutate both JavaScript, TypeScript and *.vue files. It falls back on the JavaScript mutator or the TypeScript mutator for the actual mutating.

        ## Config writers
        
        A config writer is a plugin that can rewrite your stryker configuration during initialization.
        It is used by a few packages. We're thinking about deprecating it as it can lead to complicated setups with unexpected results.

        ## \<Your plugin here\>
        You can write your own plugins for Stryker. Interested? Come and have a chat at [our gitter](https://gitter.im/stryker-mutator/stryker).
