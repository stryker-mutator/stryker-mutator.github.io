        Welcome to the Stryker for .NET documentation. Stryker for C# is also known as Stryker.NET or stryker-net.

        ### Stryker.NET
        Stryker.NET offers you mutation testing for your .NET Core and .NET Framework projects. It allows you to test your tests by temporarily inserting bugs. Stryker.NET is installed using NuGet.
